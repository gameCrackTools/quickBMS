    ABC STREAM CIPHER VERSION 3
    C REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION FOR ESTREAM PERFORMANCE TESTING FRAMEWORK

PROJECT STRUCTURE

    Folders and files in main project tree are organized as follows:

    README            - this file
    Makefile          - Makefile
    ecrypt-sync.h     - ECRYPT interface declarations
    abc.h             - declarations of ABC constants
    abc-tables.h      - predefined optimization tables
    abc.c             - core ABC routines

VARYING IMPLEMENTATION PARAMETERS

    Implementation memory consumption and therefore speed can be varied at
    compile time by ECRYPT_VARIANT parameter. Specifically, ECRYPT_VARIANT
    controls optimization window size and cycle unroll depth in ABC core
    code. Possible values for ECRYPT_VARIANT are defined in the table below.

    ECRYPT_VARIANT   Window size    Unroll depth
    1                12-12-8        16
    2                8              16
    3                8              8
