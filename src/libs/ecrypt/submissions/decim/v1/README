DECIM stream cipher reference implementation.

The DECIM stream cipher has been invented by Come Berbain,
Olivier Billet, Nicolas Courtois, Blandine Debraize, Henri Gilbert,
Louis Goubin, Aline Gouget, Louis Granboulan, Cedric Lauradoux, 
Marine Minier, Thomas Pornin and Herve Sibert.

The reference implementation is free software; its license is as close
to Public Domain as any software license can be under French law.

The implementation consists of the following files:

ecrypt-sync.h
ecrypt-config.h  
ecrypt-machine.h  
ecrypt-portable.h  
decim.h
decim.c 

The two first files come from the API published by the ECRYPT NoE for 
their call for stream cipher candidates.
The third and fourth files decim.c and decim.h contain everything
required to run DECIM.

The file decim.c contains a mechanism to select between

-> no main function:
   for this, undefine DECIM_VECTORS, and undefine DECIM_KEYSTREAM

-> a main function to generate keystream:
   for this, undefine DECIM_VECTORS, define DECIM_KEYSTREAM

-> a main function to produce 32 test vectors:
   for this, define DECIM_VECTORS

The programs have been written for the GNU gcc environment but should
compile and run on standard systems. Tested on Debian GNU/Linux on
Intel P4 and AMD Athlon.
