ECRYPT-NLS Version 2.1

NLS is a synchronous stream cipher supporting optional MAC calculation
across an arbitrary mix of encrypted and clear text.


Compilation instructions:

   1. Unpack the tarball.

   2. Edit "Makefile.config" to define the compilation environment.
      (if you are using a recent gcc on a little-endian machine,
      you can skip this step).

   3. Run "make all".


After compilation nlsref.o and nlsfast.o provide a reference implementation
and a fast implementation respectively. See nls.h for documentation on the
low level API.

In addition, ecrypt-nls.o provides an implementation of the Ecrypt
synchronous stream cipher API. See http://www.ecrypt.eu.org/stream/api.html
for documentation on this API.

The nlsref and nlsfast executables are testing and timing front ends.
   Usage: nlsref [-verbose] -test
          nlsref [-verbose] -time
          nlsref [-verbose] [key] [nonce] [count]

Other useful make targets include "test", "time", "clean", and "dist".
Sophisticated users are referred to the makefiles for more information.
