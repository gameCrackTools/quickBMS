New versions by Jean-Pierre Demailly 
<demailly@fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr>

grzip (>= 0.2.8) has been tested on x86, x86_64 and alpha processors.
It should therefore be 64-bit safe and hopefully also endian safe.

More testing on big-endian machines (e.g. LinuxPPC) is needed, since
it appears that there are still endian problems.

On 32 bit systems, grzip only works with files < 2GB in size.
This limitation can be overcome (up to 4 GB on 32-bit systems)
by using grzip with <stdin> and <stdout> rather than directly on files


- Version 0.3.0, January 31, 2007

* Added new scripts : grzdiff  grzgrep  grzmore
  and support for them in grzip main code.
  Thanks to  Simon Matter <simon.matter@invoca.ch>


- Version 0.2.9, January 6, 2007

* Access and modification times of compressed/decompressed files
  are now kept identical as those of input files

* Added 'grztar' script
     grztar -cvf archive.tar.grz  directory     (create archive)
     grztar -xvf archive.tar.grz                (decompress archive)

* Alternatively, patch to GNU tar (in build/tar.c.patch) to make it
  work directly with tar (as 'tar -cvfy *' or  'tar -xvfy *')
     
* Added support files for Debian/Ubuntu packages


- Version 0.2.8, January 5, 2007

* Added -o option and possibility of processing data through <stdin>

* grzip should hopefully be 64-bit clean

* Minor issues fixed. Should now be close from beta status...


- Version 0.2.7, January 4, 2007

* Added -z -k options

* Fixed segfault bug when using <stdout> (fclose() was applied to stdout!)


- Version 0.2.6, January 2, 2007

* Added grunzip symbolic link.

* Removed all warnings by making appropriate (hopefully irrelevant)
  changes char -> uint8 in libgrzip.c

* corrected a few minor issues in main program.

* added an option -r which removes input files after operation
  (removal of input files is now disabled by default)


- Version 0.2.5, December 28, 2006

This new version significantly extends and improves release 0.2.4 of
GRZipII by Ilya Grebnov (published on May 31, 2004).

* Correction on line 287 of libGRZip.c, for a bug which caused critical
  segfault crashes:
     uint8 * LZPBuffer=(uint8 *)malloc(*(sint32 *)(Input+8));
  changed to
     uint8 * LZPBuffer=(uint8 *)malloc(*(sint32 *)(Input+8)+1024);

* Written new interface grzip.c with more powerful command line options
  similar to gzip/bzip2.

* Internationalization

* Makefile  modified accordingly.
