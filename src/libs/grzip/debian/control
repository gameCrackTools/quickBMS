Description: GRZip
 grzip is a high-performance file compressor based on Burrows-Wheeler
 Transform, Schindler Transform, Move-To-Front, and Weighted Frequency
 Counting. It uses the Block-Sorting Lossless Data Compression
 Algorithm, which has received considerable attention in recent years
 for both its simplicity and effectiveness. This implementation has a
 compression rate of 2.234 bps on the Calgary Corpus (14 files) without
 preprocessing filters. This is essentially an adaptation/extension of
 GRZipII by Ilya Grebnov.
