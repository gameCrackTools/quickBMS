Changes in version 1.8:

The test of the value remaining in the range decoder has been removed.
(After extensive testing it has been found useless to detect corruption
in the decompressed data. Eliminating it reduces the number of false
positives for corruption and makes error detection more accurate).

The option "-a, --trailing-error", which makes minilzip exit with error
status 2 if any remaining input is detected after decompressing the last
member, has been added.

When decompressing with minilzip, the file specified with the '--output'
option is now deleted if the input is a terminal.

A harmless check failure on Windows, caused by the failed comparison of
a message in text mode, has been fixed.
